  <h1>Things I Wish I Knew Before I Applied to Yonsei</h1>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h2>1. Apply Early!</h2>
  <p>The deadlines for Yonsei and other Korean universities are very different from the US, so keep that in mind! You also have to physically mail in your application on top of submitting it online, so do that as soon as possible!</p>
  <p>I had a couple of instances in which I sent in my application and they sent me an email back that I was missing certain documents. If you send everything in early, you have enough time to get everything in before the application deadline, should there be any hiccups.</p>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>2. Incheon vs. Seoul (NJ vs. NYC)</h2>
  <p>There are not a lot of clubs based in the Songdo campus. However, some clubs that are primarily based in Songdo include:</p>
  <ul class="articlelists">

    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/designfactorykorea" target="_blank">Design Factory Korea (DFK Omelet)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/uicconnect4" target="_blank">UIC Connect4</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yia.yonsei" target="_blank">Yonsei Indonesian Association</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yonsei_fsu" target="_blank">Yonsei Foreign Student Union (partially)</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wtuxHZPsuk&t=136s" target="_blank">Introduction to Yonsei’s International Campus facilities</a></p>
  <p>Songdo does have its charms:</p>
  <ul class="articlelists">
    <li>The campus gym is very nice and big (50,000 KRW/month, 140,000 KRW/semester).</li>
    <li>Cat Stairs: a place where you can meet all of Yonsei’s (mostly vaccinated) cats.</li>
    <li>Central Park is close by and very pretty.</li>
  </ul>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>

  <h2>3. Alien Registration Card (ARC)</h2>
  <p>After you enter with your student visa, you’ll have to register to get your ARC within 90 days of your stay. A visa allows for single entry into Korea, but if you leave during break, you’ll need the ARC for re-entry.</p>
  <ul class="articlelists">
    <li>30,000 KRW - By making an appointment at <a href="https://www.hikorea.go.kr/Main.pt" target="_blank">Hi Korea</a>.</li>
    <li>45,000 KRW - Through Yonsei (submit via <a href="https://www.hirevisa.com/yonsei" target="_blank">HIREVISA</a>, but you’ll need to go to the Sinchon campus for fingerprinting and pickup).</li>
  </ul>
  <p><em>Tip: You can take your own ARC photo in self-photo booths with a white background for 4,000 won!</em></p>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>4. Health Insurance Fees</h2>
  <p>After setting up your ARC, you will receive a bill for health insurance. The first bill may be hefty as it often includes charges from your first days in Korea. Set up automatic payments through Korea National Health Insurance (NHIS):</p>
  <ul class="articlelists">
    <li>033-811-2000</li>
    <li>1577-1000, press 7 for English</li>
  </ul>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>5. Free Shuttle Buses</h2>
  <p>There are free shuttle buses on weekdays between the Incheon and Seoul campuses, operating from 8 AM to 10 PM. Registration is through the Yonsei Portal → Academic Information Systems → University Shuttle Bus Service. Spots fill up quickly, so register two days in advance at 2 PM. Arrive early to waitlist if needed.</p>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>6. Cooking on Campus</h2>
  <p>The International Campus has one shared kitchen between three dorms, accessible only by stairs. It’s inconvenient for regular cooking. Most students rely on the cafeterias:</p>
  <ul class="articlelists">
    <li>The dorm cafeteria accepts credit cards.</li>
    <li>The Y-plaza cafeteria uses the Yammi app, which requires a Korean bank account.</li>
  </ul>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>7. Yonsei’s 100 Won Breakfast</h2>
  <p>The Yonsei dorm cafeteria offers breakfast for 100 won between 8:00-9:20 AM. The Incheon campus has an all-you-can-eat option, while the Sinchon campus offers menus with banchan. Use the Yammi app to pay.</p>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>8. Additional Tips</h2>
  <ul class="articlelists">
    <li>Buy shower heads and filters from Daiso—tap water in Korea is declared safe but often filtered.</li>
    <li>Consider Physical Education classes (e.g., yoga, boxing, tennis) for easy credits (P/NP).</li>
    <li>Everytime app is a helpful tool for course schedules, reviews, and student bulletins.</li>
  </ul>
