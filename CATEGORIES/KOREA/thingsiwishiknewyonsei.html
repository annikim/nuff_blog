  <h1>Things I Wish I Knew Before I Applied to Yonsei</h1>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h2>1. Apply Early!</h2>
  <p>The deadlines for Yonsei and other Korean universities are very different from the US, so keep that in mind! You also have to physically mail in your application on top of submitting it online, so do that as soon as possible!</p>
  <p>I had a couple of instances in which I sent my application and they sent me an email back that I was missing certain documents. If you send everything in early, you have enough time to mail everything in before the application deadline, should there be any hiccups.</p>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>2. Incheon vs. Sinchon (NJ vs. NYC)</h2>
  <p>All first years are required to spend the year on the global campus in Incheon. <br>
    If I were to describe Incheon vs. Sinchon, it is essentially like being in New Jersey vs. New York City (the commute time between the two campuses is also 1 hour 30 minutes by subway). <br>
    Incheon is all recently reclaimed land, so it is not as developed and lively as Sinchon. In addition, most clubs are based in the Seoul campus in Sinchon, so Incheon sometimes feels a little bit slow. <br>
    <br>
    However, some clubs that are primarily based in Songdo include:</p>
  <ul class="articlelists">

    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/uicconnect4" target="_blank">UIC Connect4</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yia.yonsei" target="_blank">Yonsei Indonesian Association</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yonsei_fsu" target="_blank">Yonsei Foreign Student Union (partially)</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p> Check out this video for a better look of the campus! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wtuxHZPsuk&t=136s" target="_blank">Introduction to Yonsei’s International Campus facilities</a></p>
  <p>HOWEVER, Songdo does have its charms! </p>
  <ul class="articlelists">
    <li>The campus gym is very nice and big (50,000 KRW/month, 140,000 KRW/semester).</li>
    <li>Cat Stairs: a place where you can meet all of Yonsei’s (mostly vaccinated) cats.</li>
    <li>Central Park is close by and very pretty.</li>
    <li>Triple Street is a long strip of stores and restaurants, and there are markets there on the weekends!</li>

  </ul>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>

<h2>3. UD goes to Seoul, HASS and ISED stay in Incheon for four years</h2>
<p>NOT ALL MAJORS MOVE TO THE SEOUL CAMPUS AFTER THE FIRST YEAR!!</p>
<p> In UIC, majors in the UD department (Economics, Political Science, Comparative Literature, International studies, Life Science and Biotechnology) move to the Seoul campus. Those in the HASS division (Culture Design and Management, Creative Technology Management, Asian Studies... ) and ISED (Integrative Science and Engineering Division) stay in Incheon for all 4 years, so keep that mind when you apply. <br>
  In UIC, you can switch majors <em>within</em> the department of the major you originally applied for, but you cannot change to a different major in a different department (so if you are in HASS, you cannot change to UD and vice versa). This is why some people double major, so they can spend time on both campuses. </p></p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>

  <h2>4. Alien Registration Card (ARC)</h2>
  <p>After you enter with your student visa, you’ll have to register to get your ARC within 90 days of your stay.</p>
  <p>A visa allows for entry into the country only one time, but if you leave Korea during break and want to get back in, you’ll need your alien registration card (multiple entry visa). <br>
    <br>
    The documents you need are simple, but it can feel overwhelming because you need to get a bank account and other things in a whole new country in a whole new language. But don’t worry! You’ll be able to do it, just like everyone else. 
    <br><br>
    Most international students get a bank account with Woori because it’s right on campus:
    **This is Woori Card’s English number for anyone who might need it: 02-2169-5900
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two ways to get your ARC:
    </p>
  <ul class="articlelists">
    <li>30,000 KRW - By making an appointment at <a href="https://www.hikorea.go.kr/Main.pt" target="_blank">Hi Korea</a>.</li>
      <p>They get booked fast, especially in the beginning of the semester when international students are filing for their ARCs, so hurry to get an appointment (*make sure to print a paper of your appointment confirmation and number).      </p>
    <li>45,000 KRW - Through Yonsei (submit via <a href="https://www.hirevisa.com/yonsei" target="_blank">HIREVISA</a>, but you’ll need to go to the Sinchon campus for fingerprinting and pickup).</li>
    <p> It is a little bit more expensive, but Yonsei takes care of everything; you don’t have to go to the immigration office! <br>
      You submit your documents via scanned pdfs to https://www.hirevisa.com/yonsei under ‘New RC Application’  <br>
      The only con is you have to go to the Sinchon campus for fingerprint scans and to pick up your ARC, which can be a little inconvenient if the days of pickup fall on your class times.
    </p>      
  </ul>
  <p><em>Tip: You can take your own ARC photo in self-photo booths with a white background for 4,000 won!</em></p>
  
  <p>
  Make sure to report any address changes to your local district office (or you will be fined) <br>
You can find yours in this <a target="_blank" href="https://www.angloinfo.com/how-to/south-korea/seoul/moving/residency/local-administration">list</a>
  </p>
  

  <p>After about 2 years, you will have to renew your ARC (60,000 KRW).<br>
    This blog helps break it down! <a href="https://thisonelittledid.com/2017/12/17/renewing-arc-korea/" target="_blank">Guide to renewing ARC</a> </p>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>5. Health Insurance Fees</h2>
  <p>After setting up your ARC, you will receive a bill for health insurance. The first bill may be hefty as it often includes charges from your first days in Korea. <br>
    You can set up automatic payments over the phone by calling Korea National Health Insurance (NHIS) or through their app. You are only billed for the time you are in Korea, but you will have to call them at the end of the semester (if you are going back home) to cancel the automatic payments:
  </p>
  <ul class="articlelists">
    <li>033-811-2000</li>
    <li>1577-1000, press 7 for English</li>
  </ul>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>6. Free Shuttle Buses</h2>
  <p>There are free shuttle buses on weekdays between the Incheon and Seoul campuses, operating from 8 AM to 10 PM. <br>
    Registration is through the Yonsei Portal → Academic Information Systems → University Shuttle Bus Service. <br>
    <br>
    Make sure to hurry! Registration opens two days before the desired day of appointment at 2PM, but spots fill up quickly. <br>
    Those who are unable to grab a spot typically come a little earlier and stand in the “waitlist” to grab any extra seats should there be no-shows or cancellations (if you come early, you will most likely be able to get a seat!). 
  
    
  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>7. Cooking on Campus</h2>
 <p>
  There is one kitchen between three dorms, but it is only accessible by walking 5 flights of stairs. <br>
  I cooked one time, but the hassle of bringing food, pots, and pans back and forth was too much work for me. There are tables in the kitchen, but no chairs.
  <br><br>
	The student cafeteria is open on weekdays. There are two on the International Campus: one in the dorms and one underneath the library in Y-plaza.  <br>
  The one in the dorms can be paid for by credit card, but the other Y-plaza cafeteria can only be paid for using the Yammi app.

  <br><br>
  There are two places to go for food outside of campus that are about 1km away- Triple Street and Campus Town. <br>
  Campus town has more student-friendly prices, but Triple Street has more fun stores. 

  </p>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>8. Yonsei’s 100 Won Breakfast ($0.06)</h2>
  <p>The Yonsei dorm cafeteria offers breakfast for 100 won between the hours of 8:00-9:20AM. <br>
    <br>
    The Incheon campus is all-you-can-eat, but they sometimes run out of food close to 9:20am, depending on how popular the menu is that day.<br>
    The Sinchon campus offers two different menus with banchan.<br>
    Breakfast used to be offered for 1,000 won ($0.75), but it was recently subsidized further by the government to just 100 won ($0.06)! <br><br>

    * Note: You can only buy breakfast through the Yammi app in Sinchon campus; the last time I was in Incheon campus they had an option for foreigners who did not yet have a korean credit card. 
    </p>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
  <h2>9. Yonsei Shower Water Is Dirty</h2>
    <p>
      Everyone buys shower heads (5,000 won) and filters (3 for 5,000) at Daiso. <br>
      Korean tap water is technically declared safe to drink but Koreans all buy water bottles and filters. 
    </p>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br>
    <h2>10. Physical Education Classes at Yonsei</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re looking at early graduation like me, physical education classes (ex. Pilates, ballet, yoga, boxing, taekwondo, tennis, etc.) are easy credits. However, some classes like tennis and ballet tend to be pretty popular and thus competitive to get in <br>
      <br>
    Although they’re all usually taught in Korean, teachers are usually understanding with foreigners and the classes are P/NP. Although it’s only 1 credit, it’s an easy one.
      <br><br>
    There are also book club classes for 1 credit!
    </p>

  <!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <br>
    <h2>11. UIC First</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re still a first year, this doesn’t apply to you. yet. <br>
    If you’re a sophomore student or above dealing with mileage points for course registration, <a target="_blank" href="https://uic.yonsei.ac.kr/main/news.asp?mid=m06_01_01">UIC Announcements</a> Academic Affairs section posts about important news like course registration about a month before the semester starts.
      <br><br>
      If you are any of the following majors:
    </p>
      <ul class="articlelists">
        <li> UD Economics </li>
        <li>UD Political Science and International Relations </li>
        <li>HASS Quantitative Risk Management </li>
        <li>Asian Studies</li>
      </ul>
    <p>
      UIC allows you to register for major courses early to guarantee yourself a spot (because the above majors and their courses are usually very competitive). 
    </p>

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <br>
  <h2>12. Everytime</h2>
  <p>
    Korea’s online university app: essentially ratemyprofessor.com, (more PG) fizz, and notion all wrapped in one. <br>
  <br>
    The app includes course schedules shareable with friends, student bulletin boards, and college course reviews.<br>
  The reviews can be helpful but take them with a grain of salt: the ideal english-taught class for a native Korean speaker looks a lot different than that of an international student. (Koreans typically rate professors who require participation/discussion lower and prefer exams over papers).
