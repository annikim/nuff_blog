  <h1>Things I Wish I Knew Before I Came to Korea</h1>

  <h2>1. Getting skincare at the best prices:</h2>
    <p>I’m wary of buying anything that’s not from Olive Young or the store front itself because of fakes (especially around Myeongdong area) that are sold for super cheap.<br>
        *Skincare may also be mega-marked down if it has a short shelf life (check the expiration date)!</li>
        <p>- Get an Olive Young membership!</p>
        <ul class="articlelists">
            <li>- Download the Korean app (global Olive Young not eligible) and make an account. You don’t need to make a purchase to activate this, but this opens up so many more member-only discounts.</li>
            <li>- Olive Young has big “Olive Day” sales, which are sales for their Olive Young members, on the 25-27th of every month, but even if you aren’t a member it’s still worth going! There are many sales for non-Olive members, they do lots of 1+1s, include samples, etc.</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Olive Young Sales:<br></p>
        <ul class="articlelists">
            <li>- Big Bang Sale: end of August</li>
            <li>- Black Friday sale: all of November</li>
            <li>- Olive Day sale: 25-27th of every month (member-exclusive discounts)</li>
            <li>- Quarterly Sales Events: typically first week of March, June, September, December</li>
            <li>-Olive Young Picks: 1-3rd of every month, Olive Young's Pick products come with freebies and are further discounted</li>
            <li>-Olive Young Kit: 1st of every month until stock runs out, if members spend a certain amount, they will receive an Olive Young Kit, which includes Olive Young's Pick product samples. </li>
        </ul>
<br>

<h2>2. Korean Skincare is not necessarily cheaper in Korea vs. US:</h2>
<p>With the exception of special Olive Young sales, when I compare prices from the Korean storefronts on Amazon with Olive Young, after the currency exchange rate, there ends up not being as much of a difference. Especially with Prime Day deals in the US or Costco deals.</p>

<br>

<h2>3. Korea runs on Coupang:</h2>
<p>Coupang is equivalent to Amazon, it is used for anything and everything. People get groceries delivered with Coupang, food with Coupang Eats, and even skincare, clothes, etc.</p>
<ul class="articlelists">
    <li>Coupang offers a prime subscription, Coupang WOW membership, at ~8,000 won/month ($5.42), which usually pays for itself with how much you save on food delivery and member discounts.</li>
    <li>* Food delivery through the Coupang Eats app comes with no delivery fee for Coupang WOW members!</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h2>4. You can find literally everything in Daiso, so check Daiso first before you go to other stores like Homeplus:</h2>
<p>Daiso has everything from laundry detergent and toilet cleaner to kitchen knives and camping tools to stationery and plushies. For cheap. At Daiso, you get what you pay for (e.g., a 5,000 won air freshener is typically better quality than a 3,000 won one).</p>

<br>
<h2>5. SIM cards are not a must but definitely help!</h2>
<p>You end up using your phone a lot for directions and subway transfers; data has definitely saved me when I didn’t know how to ask for help.</p>
<p>Lots of international students like Woori Mobile (<a href="https://www.woorimobile.kr/prepaid">https://www.woorimobile.kr/prepaid</a>) because they can ship the card to your address, but you can get a pre-paid SIM card at any mobile store!</p>

<br>
<h2>6. Climate Card Korea:</h2>
<p>It is a pre-paid transportation card providing unlimited use of public transportation (e.g., subway, bus) and Ttareungi (Seoul Bike) in Seoul for a period of 30 days.</p>
<ul class="articlelists">
    <li>If you take the bus or subway multiple times a day, this can often pay for itself.</li>
    <li>- With the Youth discount (ages 19-39):</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Price without Seoul Bike access: 55,000 KRW/month (~$38)</li>
        <li>Price with Bike access: 58,000 KRW/month (~$40)</li>
    </ul>
    <li>- Regular price:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>With Seoul Bike access: 65,000 KRW/month</li>
        <li>Without: 62,000 KRW/month</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>7. Sorting Trash:</h2>
<p>You need to purchase specific trash bags (<strong>종량제 봉투: j-oh-ng-lya-ng-jeh b-oh-ng-too</strong>) based on your neighborhood; these can be bought at any convenience store or local supermarket.</p>
<p>Buying the neighborhood trash bags is not something to worry about if you are living in a dorm, but for those living off-campus, take note also of your trash-pickup days and times!</p>
