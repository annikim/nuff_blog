<h1>The Truth about College</h1>

<h2>
    Sometimes, college is NOT the best years of your life. <br><br>
    And that is okay!

</h2>
    
<p>
    Sometimes, college is getting 43% on a midterm and seriously considering dropping out because you feel too stupid for college. <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is realizing that you don’t know what you’re doing or what you want to do or where you’re going, and you can’t help but compare yourself to the people who already somehow have consulting jobs and amazon internships. <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is feeling pressured to find a high-paying job to make your expensive degree worth it even though that’s not what you want to do. <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is feeling overwhelmed and exhausted with decision fatigue because all the things that had previously been laid out for you in a rigid time-table are now up to your discretion and management.  <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is feeling lonely because this is the first time away from the home you grew up in.  <br>
<br>
    BUT<br><br>

    Sometimes, college is receiving feedback from your professor and doing better on the next exam. <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is realizing grades aren't everything. <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is realizing that even though you don't know what you're doing, neither does anybody else. <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is trying, failing, and learning from new things. <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is building new habits and breaking old cycles. <br>
    <br>
    Sometimes, college is learning how to find your people. <br>
    <br>
    
    All this to say, feeling like you don’t have it figured out is okay. <br>
    Recognizing that you don’t know what you’re doing is an invitation for new opportunities. <br>
    Something good is coming for you!
