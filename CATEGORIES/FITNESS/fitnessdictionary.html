  <br>
  <h2 id="basictermsheader">Basic Terms</h2>
  
  <h3 id="repsheader"><strong>Reps (Repetitions)</strong></h3>
  <p>The number of times you perform an exercise in one set.<br><em>Example:</em> 10 squats in a row counts as 10 reps.</p>
  
  <h3 id="setsheader"><strong>Sets</strong></h3>
  <p>A group of repetitions performed consecutively.<br><em>Example:</em> 3 sets of 10 reps means performing 10 reps of an exercise three times, resting in between.</p>
  
  <h3 id="liftheader"><strong>Lift</strong></h3>
  <p>A common shorthand for “weightlifting” or “lifting weights.”<br><em>Example:</em> "I’m going to lift today" simply means doing a weightlifting workout.</p>
  
  <h3 id="benchheader"><strong>Bench</strong></h3>
  <p>A shorthand for “bench press,” one of the most popular compound exercises where you press weight while lying on a bench.</p>
  
  <br>
  <h2 id="trainingstylesheader">Training Styles and Methods</h2>
  
  <h3 id="untilfailureheader"><strong>Until Failure</strong></h3>
  <p>Performing an exercise until you physically cannot do another repetition with good form. This method drives strength and muscle growth.</p>
  
  <h3 id="progressiveoverloadheader"><strong>Progressive Overload</strong></h3>
  <p>Gradually increasing the weight, reps, or intensity of an exercise over time to continue building strength and muscle.</p>
  
  <h3 id="tutheader"><strong>Time Under Tension (TUT)</strong></h3>
  <p>The amount of time your muscles are under strain during a set.<br><em>Example:</em> Slowing down reps to 4 seconds on the eccentric (lowering) phase and 2 seconds on the concentric (lifting) phase increases time under tension, enhancing muscle growth.</p>
  
  <h3 id="unilateralheader"><strong>Unilateral Exercises</strong></h3>
  <p>Exercises that work one side of the body at a time.<br><em>Example:</em> Single-leg squats, one-arm dumbbell rows, and Bulgarian split squats are unilateral exercises.</p>
  
  <h3 id="egoliftingheader"><strong>Ego Lifting</strong></h3>
  <p>Lifting heavier weights than you can handle with proper form, often to impress others rather than focusing on effective training. Can lead to injury or reinforce poor technique.</p>
  
  <h3 id="supersetheader"><strong>Superset</strong></h3>
  <p>Performing two exercises back-to-back with minimal to no rest.<br><em>Example:</em> Doing a set of push-ups immediately followed by a set of rows.<br>This method can save time but may lead to burnout or injury if overused.</p>
  
  <h3 id="amrapheader"><strong>AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible)</strong></h3>
  <p>A workout structure where you perform as many repetitions or rounds of an exercise as possible within a set time frame. This is an efficient way to maximize your workload if you’re short on time.</p>
  
  <h3 id="circuitheader"><strong>Circuit Training</strong></h3>
  <p>A workout consisting of a series of exercises performed one after the other with minimal rest. Each "circuit" is repeated a set number of times.</p>
  
  <h3 id="hiitheader"><strong>HIIT (High-Intensity Interval Training)</strong></h3>
  <p>A training style where you alternate between short bursts of intense exercise and rest or low-intensity activity.<br><em>Example:</em> A Tabata workout involves 20 seconds of exercise, 10 seconds of rest, alternating for 8 rounds (a 4-minute workout blast with maximum effort).</p>
  
  <h3 id="calisthenicsheader"><strong>Calisthenics</strong></h3>
  <p>A training style using only body weight<br>
  - <em>Example exercises:</em> pistol squat, dragon squat, pull-up, push-up.</p>

  <br>
  <h2 id="typesofexercisesheader">Types of Exercises</h2>
  
  <h3 id="compoundheader"><strong>Compound Exercises</strong></h3>
  <p>Exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses.</p>
  
  <h3 id="isolationheader"><strong>Isolation Exercises</strong></h3>
  <p>Exercises that focus on a single muscle group, such as bicep curls or calf raises.</p>
  
  <br>
  <h2 id="measuringstrengthheader">Measuring Strength and Performance</h2>
  
  <h3 id="1rmheader"><strong>1RM (One-Rep Max)</strong></h3>
  <p>The maximum amount of weight you can lift for a single repetition of a given exercise. This is used to measure strength and set training goals.</p>
  
  <h3 id="prheader"><strong>PR (Personal Record)</strong></h3>
  <p>Your best-ever performance in a particular exercise, whether it's a max weight or the most reps completed.<br><em>Example:</em> "I hit a new PR on my squat today—200 lbs!"</p>
  
  <h3 id="romheader"><strong>ROM (Range of Motion)</strong></h3>
  <p>The full movement potential of a joint or exercise. A full ROM ensures muscles are stretched and contracted completely.<br><em>Example:</em> In a squat, proper ROM involves lowering your hips until your thighs are parallel to the ground or lower (depending on mobility).</p>
  
  <br>
  <h2 id="workoutstructuresheader">Workout Structures</h2>
  
  <h3 id="splitsheader"><strong>Workout Split</strong></h3>
  <p>Refers to how a week’s workouts are divided based on muscle groups or goals (athleticism, strength, aesthetics).</p>
  <p><em>Examples of splits:</em><br>
    - Body Part Split: Dedicating different days of the week to major muscle groups (e.g., chest and triceps on Monday, legs on Tuesday, etc.).<br>
    - Upper-Lower Split: Divides your body into two halves (upper body on Monday, lower body on Tuesday, etc.).<br>
    - Push-Pull-Legs Split: You work your “pushing” muscles in one workout, your “pulling” muscles in another, and your lower body on the next.<br>
  </p>
  
  <h3 id="pushdayheader"><strong>Push Day</strong></h3>
  <p>A workout day focused on "pushing" movements, such as bench presses, shoulder presses, and tricep exercises. These exercises target the chest, shoulders, and triceps.</p>
  
  <h3 id="pulldayheader"><strong>Pull Day</strong></h3>
  <p>A workout day dedicated to "pulling" movements, such as pull-ups, rows, and bicep curls. These exercises target the back, biceps, and rear shoulders (aka rear delts).</p>
  
  <h2 id="fitnessgoalsheader">Fitness Goals and Phases</h2>
  
  <h3 id="bulkheader"><strong>Bulk</strong></h3>
  <p>A phase where you eat in a calorie surplus to build muscle mass, often combined with heavy strength training.</p>
  
  <h3 id="cutheader"><strong>Cut</strong></h3>
  <p>A phase where you eat in a calorie deficit to reduce body fat while maintaining muscle mass.</p>
  
  <h3 id="bodyrecompheader"><strong>Body Recomposition (Body Recomp)</strong></h3>
  <p>A process where you simultaneously lose fat and gain muscle, typically by balancing nutrition and resistance training.</p>
  
  <br>
  <h2 id="othertermsheader">Other Fitness Terms</h2>
  
  <h3 id="domsheader"><strong>DOMS (Delayed Onset Muscle Soreness)</strong></h3>
  <p>Muscle soreness that typically occurs 24 to 48 hours after a workout due to microscopic tears in muscle fibers during exercise.</p>
  
  <h3 id="nattyheader"><strong>Natty (Natural)</strong></h3>
  <p>A term used to describe someone who builds muscle without using performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), such as anabolic steroids.</p>
  
  <h3 id="gearheader"><strong>Gear</strong></h3>
  <p>A slang term referring to performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs), such as steroids or growth hormones.</p>
