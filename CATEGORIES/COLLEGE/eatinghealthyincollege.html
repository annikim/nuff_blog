  <h1>Eating Healthy in Dorms as a College Student</h1>

  <p>I know college can get busy and ramen can become the norm, so here are some easy kitchen-free meals to fuel your brain!</p>
  
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<br>
<h2> 1. CHIA SEED PUDDING</h2>
<img class="EatingHealthyInDorms" src="../../images/chiapudding1.png" alt="chia pudding example">

<p>
    It is incredibly easy to make and lasts in your fridge for up to a week! You can add lots of toppings of choice to switch it up, so you never get sick of it. <br>
<br>
    Benefits: chia seeds are full of fiber for my girlies with stomach problems, they have omega-3s for healthy hair and skin, and will keep you full for a long time
<br><br>
    Tip: check your chia seed expiration dates, and add some greek yogurt in for extra protein! 
<br><br> 
    How I make it:<br>
    (to be honest I don’t have any measuring cups with me in college so I just eyeball these measurements)<br>
- Take a glass jar or container and fill it with 3 tbsp of chia seeds <br>
- Add milk of choice (cow, oat, almond, chocolate, protein shake, etc.) so the seeds are fully submerged (I also stir in greek yogurt here) <br>
- Immediately stir the seeds in the milk so they are  (or else they will get clumpy, and no one wants a mouthful of seeds) <br>
- Close the jar and Wait 5-10 minutes <br>
- Stir again <br>
- Allow chia seeds to absorb liquid mixture for at least 10-20 minutes, or until thick pudding consistency. (I like to let mine sit in the fridge overnight) <br>
- Add toppings of choice (I like to add frozen berries and mango because they last in the fridge for a long time, as well as pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, and granola) <br>
<br>
    I meal-prep several jars at a time so they are convenient meals for later, and it helps me get more fiber in (because most college dorm meals are not high in fiber)

<br><br>
<h2> 2. TUNA RICE WITH SEAWEED</h2>
<img class="EatingHealthyInDorms" src="../../images/tunarice.png" alt="tuna rice with seaweed example">
<p>
    Benefits: easy high-protein meal, tuna has omega-3s for healthy hair and skin, seaweed is full of minerals for my dehydrated girlies <br>
<br>
    Note: I usually get tuna in water for less calories, but they both have their pros and cons <br>
    - If you drain your tuna, it is better to get tuna in water because draining tuna in oil can take some of the omega-3 fatty acids with it <br>
    - Oil packed tuna has more vitamin D and selenium <br>
    <br>
    How I make it:<br>
    - Take a microwaveable rice (buying these in bulk is cheap and lasts for a long time) and follow the instructions on the package <br>
    - Drain (or don’t) a can of tuna (or two cans, I don’t know how hungry you are) into a bowl <br>
    - Mix rice and tuna together <br>
    - Add toppings of choice (sriracha mayo, sesame oil, furikake, etc.) <br>
    - Open a packet of seaweed and enjoy <br>
</p>

 <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
 <br><br>
 <h2>3. EGG RICE</h2>
 
 <p>
     Benefits: egg is an easy protein booyah<br>
 <br>
     How I eat it:<br>
     - Cook two eggs scrambled, mix microwaveable rice, add sauce of choice (furikake, gochujang, etc.) <br>
     - OR Take two hard boiled eggs, mix microwaveable rice, add sauce of choice (furikake, soy sauce with chili flakes and green onion, etc.)
 </p>
  <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>
<br><br>
<h2>3. SNACK: BROCCOLI WITH SESAME OIL SAUCE</h2>
<p>
    Benefits: broccoli is one of the super-vegetables, and the sauce makes them yummy to eat <br>
<br>
    If you have a kitchen, this is an easy way to get your vegetables in <br>
<br>
    How I make it:<br>
    - Put water in a pot and cover it to boil
    - Cut the stems of the broccoli 
    - Wash the florets
    - Once the water is boiling, add the broccoli florets to the pot. 
    - Cook the broccoli, uncovered, for 2-3 minutes.
    - Drain in a colander and transfer to a container 
    - Let it cool before putting it in the fridge 
    <br><br>
    Making the sauce: <br>
    - Sesame oil<br>
    - Salt <br>
    - Pepper <br>
    <br>
    I am not usually a big fan of vegetables, but this combination is so yummy. I can eat vegetables for days with this sauce. You can store the sauce and broccoli in the fridge to enjoy for days. 
</p>

 <br><br>
<h2> 4. NATTO WITH RICE AND SEAWEED</h2>
<p>
    Benefits: natto (fermented soybeans) has mad vitamin K for strong bones, is a high-protein high-fiber food, and has probiotics for better gut health (for my girlies with stummy issues) <br>
<br>
    Note: it has a kind of stringy texture like okra and a distinct smell, so I would call it an acquired taste. But health-wise, loaded with benefits. <br>
    - Take your vitamin D pill with natto (vitamin K) for better absorption (if you feel tired/ have brain fog, you are probably vitamin D deficient. Our bodies can’t actually absorb much vitamin D from the sun, but that’s for another article). 
    <br><br>
    How I make it:<br>
    - I usually buy it in bulk and put it in the freezer, so it doesn’t go bad <br>
    - On the day of, I’ll put it either in the fridge to defrost or on my counter <br>
    - If it's still frozen and you forget to take it out, you can microwave it for 30 seconds or so (*but this may compromise certain nutrients and beneficial bacteria in natto)<br>
    - The packets usually come with mustard and soy sauce, you just put them in and mix everything together until it gets stringy <br>
    - Then heat up your microwaveable rice and open a packet of seaweed and eat<br>
