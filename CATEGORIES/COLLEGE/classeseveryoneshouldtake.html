  <h1>Classes I Think Everyone Should Take in College</h1>

<p>I always get frustrated because many classes are incredibly niche and not always applicable to the real-world, so here are some classes I have taken that I believe will be useful to you- no matter what your career path or goals may be.

<h2>1. Nutrition</h2>
<p>
    It’s amazing how little most people know about their own bodies and how nutrition truly affects everything—from energy levels to brain fog and long-term health. <br>
    A single nutrition class can open your eyes to how food fuels you and teach you to make more informed choices that prevent future health issues. <br>
Especially in college when students focus on their grades and internships, often at the expense of adequate sleep and nutrition, this class is a reminder of what’s really important.

<h2>2. Public Speaking</h2>
<p>
    Everybody hates it- which is why it’s so important to get good at it!<br>
No matter what career you pursue, your ability to speak confidently in front of others can open all sorts of doors of opportunity. <br>
The skills you’ll learn in this class will help you during presentations, interviews, and even social settings. Confidence attracts success!
<br><br>
When I took public speaking, I was so nervous and afraid of being judged by my peers. But I quickly realized that everyone else felt the exact same way! In fact, our shared vulnerability helped us bond, and by the end of the semester, the class was a supportive community of friends and inside jokes.
