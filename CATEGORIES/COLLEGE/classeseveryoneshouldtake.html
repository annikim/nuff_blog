  <h1>Classes I Think Everyone Should Take in College</h1>

<p>I always get frustrated because many classes are incredibly niche and not always applicable to the real-world, so here are some classes I have taken that I believe will be useful to you- no matter what your career path or goals may be. 
    <em>(compiled in no particular order or ranking)</em>
</p>
<br>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2>1. Nutrition</h2>
<p>
    It’s amazing how little most people know about their own bodies. <br><br>
    A single nutrition class can open your eyes to how food fuels you and teach you to make more informed choices that prevent future health issues. <br>
Especially in college when students focus on their grades and internships, often at the expense of adequate sleep and nutrition, this class is a reminder of what’s really important. 
</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br><br>
<h2>2. Public Speaking</h2>
<p>
    Everybody hates it- which is why it’s so important to get good at it!<br><br>
No matter what career you pursue, your ability to speak confidently in front of others can open all sorts of doors of opportunity. <br>
The skills you’ll learn in this class will help you during presentations, interviews, and even social settings. Confidence attracts success!<br>
*Also, the amount of people who do not know how to make a proper and readable PPT kills me
<br><br>
When I took public speaking, I was so nervous and afraid of being judged by my peers. But I quickly realized that everyone else felt the exact same way! In fact, our shared vulnerability helped us bond, and by the end of the semester, the class was a supportive community of friends and inside jokes.
</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br><br>
<h2>3. Physical Education Classes</h2>
<p>
  In college, fitness is sometimes the last thing on a student's mind. <br><br>
  Taking PE classes forces you to dedicate time in your day to your physical well-being, and it teaches you new ways of regulating and coping with emotions (which is especially helpful during exam season). <br> 
  I actually got into weightlifting when I entered college (I had never touched weights before then), and now it is my favorite part of the day. <br>
  Also, there are so many types of PE classes to choose from! I’ve taken ballet, line dancing, yoga, and more—it’s the perfect chance to explore what you love.
</p>  
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br><br>
<h2>4. Personal Finance</h2>
<p>
  Managing your money is a life skill you’ll use every single day. <br><br>
  A personal finance course will teach you how to budget, invest, understand taxes, and plan for financial independence. <Br>
  This is a <em>MUST TAKE</em>--seriously! Not knowing the basics (having to actually <em>invest</em> your money once you put it in a Roth IRA account, the difference between index funds, individual stocks, ETFs, bonds, etc.) can have serious financial consequences. Let’s aim for early retirement and stress-free tax seasons!
</p>  
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br><br>
<h2>5. Intro to Economics</h2>
<p>
  I am not a fan of economics, but a rudimentary understanding will help your understanding of the world’s financial systems as both a consumer and a producer. <br><br>

  This class teaches you why the government can’t just print more money, and you’ll finally somewhat understand the news. 
</p>  
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br><br>
<h2>6. Psychology or Sociology (or any emotions-related course)</h2>
<p>
  Understanding how people think and why they behave the way they do is incredibly valuable. <br><br>
  
  These types of courses increase your self-awareness, help you build better connections, and improve empathy. 
</p>
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br><br>
<h2>7. Something Fun!</h2>
<p>
  College doesn’t have to be all about academics!<br><br>
  Take at least one class purely for fun—it’s a great way to unwind from the daily pressures of student life, exercise your creativity, and meet new friends. <br>
  Whether it’s ceramics, film, or even a “dating and marriage” course (my college has one!), you never know when a fun hobby might turn into something more meaningful.
</p>  
<!-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<br><br>
<h2>8. Negotiations</h2>
<p>
  Even if we don’t realize it, we’re always negotiating. <br><br>
A negotiations class can be a game-changer–especially when it comes to salary discussions, resolving conflicts, or managing social interactions. <br>
Knowing how to negotiate well gives you an edge in both your professional and personal life.
</p>
